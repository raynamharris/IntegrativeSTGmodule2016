## Overall objective
The overall objective of the Molecular Phase of the Hippocampus Module is to equip students with comprehensive understanding of the relationships between molecular activity in the nervous system and complex behavior. Learning experiences change network properties in order to support memory but how these experiences change the transcript makeup of neurons that shape network activity is understudied. The overarching goal of the module is for students to learn strategies to bridge our separate understandings of memory by exploring how traces of a spatial memory are encoded in gene expression changes of neurons across the hippocampus network.
