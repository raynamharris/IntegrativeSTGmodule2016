# The 2016 Integrative STG Module

Welcome to the resources webpage for the 2016 Integrative STG Module! We are really excited to spend the next two weeks with you!

Please use this webpage as a community resource where you will find links to lessons, protocols, useful tools, and information about module and the instructors. Please bookmark it for easy access.

## Meet the Instructors
During this module, you will learn a lot from [David Schulz](https://schulz.biology.missouri.edu), [Eva Fischer](http://evakfischer.weebly.com), [Rayna Harris](http://raynamharris.github.io),
[Adam Northcutt](https://schulz.biology.missouri.edu), and [Hans Hofmann](http://cichlid.biosci.utexas.edu). You can also read our short biographies [here](https://github.com/raynamharris/IntegrativeSTGmodule2016/blob/master/Instructors.md).
