## Modules Instructors and Developers

###[David Schulz](https://schulz.biology.missouri.edu), University of Missouri  

The general theme of the work in the Schulz lab is a desire to understand the mechanisms underlying neural network function from both the perspective of an individual cell as well as the coordinated activity of the network as a whole. Our model systems are the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) and cardiac ganglion (CG), as well as the mouse spinal cord. The STG has been at the forefront of electrophysiological questions of neural network function for over 3 decades. Our approach seeks to take this well characterized network to the molecular level to ask detailed questions about the interaction between the genome and the electrophysiogical output of individual cells and the network as a whole. Our goal is to use these model systems to shed light on both the endogenous mechanisms of neural network function, but also responses of these networks in response to injury and other perturbations that challenge the system.

### [Eva Fischer](http://evakfischer.weebly.com), Harvard University

Dr. Eva Fischer is interested in the mechanisms by which behavioral diversity evolves and is maintained, both within and among species. She uses integrative approaches to understand mechanisms underlying behavioral evolution, including the role of developmental plasticity and phenotypic integration, and whether parallel evolutionary events share common molecular, developmental, and neural substrates. During her doctoral work, Eva took advantage of Trinidadian guppies to understand how genetic and environmental forces interact to drive behavioral evolution within a single species. Now, during her postdoctoral work in Dr. Lauren O’Connell’s Lab, she is taking advantage of the fantastic variation in behavior (and other traits) in poison frogs to understand inter– as well as intra-specific patterns. Specifically, she is examining to what extent similar parental care behaviors are mediated by similar neural, hormonal, and molecular substrates across individuals and species.


### [Rayna Harris](http://raynamharris.github.io), University of Texas at Austin

Rayna Harris 4th year graduate student in the cellular and molecular biology program at The University of Texas in Austin. She has been a member of Hans Hofmann’s lab since 2009, when I joined as the lab manager. Her research interests focus on the neuromolecular and endocrine mechanisms that regulate social behavior. Rayna has also been a Course Developer since 2013, working to develop tools molecular module for the NS&B and conducting a collaborative research project that unites the expertise of the Hofmann and Fenton Labs.

### [Adam Northcutt](https://schulz.biology.missouri.edu), University of Missouri

Adam Northcutt is a 2nd year graduate student in the Biological Sciences PhD Program at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  He has been a member of the David Schulz lab since 2014, where he has worked to understand the underlying molecular characteristics that determine neuronal function.


### [Hans Hofmann](http://cichlid.biosci.utexas.edu), University of Texas at Austin

Hans Hofmann is professor of integrative biology at The University of Texas at Austin. His research interests focus on the neural and molecular mechanisms of social behavior. He received his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Leipzig and the Max-Planck Institute in Seewiesen. As a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, he began taking advantage of the astonishing diversity and plasticity of cichlid fishes to study how the social environment regulates brain and behavior. While a Bauer Genome Fellow at Harvard University, he pioneered behavioral genomics in cichlids to analyze and understand the molecular and neural basis of social behavior and its evolution. He developed many of the functional genomics resources for cichlids and has been a co-initiator of the cichlid genome consortium, which successfully completed the sequencing of five cichlid genomes at the Broad Institute. He received the prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship (in Neuroscience) and was awarded the Frank A. Beach Early Career Award from the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology. Hans Hofmann has been an NS&B Course Co-director since 2013 and a faculty member of this module since it was formed in 2014.
